# Publish as a Single-page Web App

One of the benefits of creating AI applications with Dify is that you can publish a Single-page AI web app accessible to all users on the internet within minutes. This Web App will operate based on your Prompt and orchestration settings.

- If you're using the self-hosted open-source version, the application will run on your server

- If you're using the cloud service, the application will be hosted at <https://udify.app/>.


### Publishing an AI Website

On the **Monitoring** page, you can find the Web App management card. After enabling the access switch, you'll get a URL that can be publicly shared on the internet.

We have pre-set beautiful Web App UI for the following two types of applications:

- **Text Generation (Preview)**

{% content-ref url="text-generator.md" %}
[text-generator.md](text-generator.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

- **Conversation (Preview)**

{% content-ref url="conversation-application.md" %}
[conversation-application.md](conversation-application.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Setting Up Your AI Site

Click the **Settings** button on the Web App card to configure some options for the AI site. These will all be visible to users:
